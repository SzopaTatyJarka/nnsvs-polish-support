Files for Polish NNSVS dataset creation

The repo contains HED and .table files required for NNSVS to support training and using Polish.
The phoneme set is based on Fy≈Ñ's Arpabet which mimics the way the language is written, as well as some additional phonemes to cover lesser appearing sounds in the language.
The estimated amount of audio required for a high-quality result is 2-3 hours without silences.

*NNSVS Model showcase built on 1 hour of refference data for acoustics and 1,5 hours for timelag and duration*

## Information and Directions

The HED file is written by hand and might not work with other tools without proper modifications.

"SzopaTatyJarka PL NN Phoneme set.txt" is a reference for the phonetic system used in the support.

The `/dic` folder contains a basic table for phonetic training.

The `/hed` folders contain the HED file.

You can change the hed file in config.yaml, which is found at `/train/config.yaml`.
Note that while training you h

ave to change "in_dim" in `/train/conf/train/*/model/*.yaml` to following values if using "sztp_polish.hed":

* acoustic: 317
* duration: 313
* timelag: 313
