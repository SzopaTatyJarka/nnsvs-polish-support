Files for Polish NNSVS dataset creation

The repo contains HED and .table files required for NNSVS to support training and using Polish.
The phoneme set is based on Fy≈Ñ's Alphasing which mimics the way the language is written, as well as some additional phonemes to cover lesser appearing sounds in the language.
The estimated amount of audio required for a high-quality result is 1-2 hours without silences.

## Information and Directions

The HED file is written by hand and might not work with other tools without proper modifications.

"SzopaTatyJarka PL NN Phoneme set.txt" is a reference for the phonetic system used in the support.

The `/dic` folder contains a basic table for phonetic training.

The `/hed` folders contain the HED file.

You can change the hed file in config.yaml, which is found at `/train/config.yaml`.
Note that while training you have to change "in_dim" in `/train/conf/train/*/model/*.yaml` to following values if using one of the hed files:

"sztp_polish.hed":

* duration: 317
* timelag: 317
* acoustic: 321
* in_rest_idx: 11
* in_lfx0_idx: 272

"sztp_polish_mdn.hed":

* duration: 209
* timelag: 209
* acoustic: 213
* in_rest_idx: 11
* in_lfx0_idx: 164
